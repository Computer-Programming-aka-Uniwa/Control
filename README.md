## Theory Topics

### Topic 1a: What do you know about the `if` command?

The `if` statement is a control structure in C used to execute a block of code if a specified condition evaluates to true. It allows for decision-making in the flow of a program.

### Topic 1b: What do you know about the `switch` command?

The `switch` statement is another control structure in C, used to execute one of many code blocks based on the value of a variable. Unlike `if`, it is used for handling multiple cases more efficiently, especially when there are numerous possible values for a single variable.

## Source Code Issues

### Topic 2: Marking and Documentation

This section addresses issues found in the following source code files:
- **`if.c`**: Documentation focuses on the structure and flow of `if` statements.
- **`if1.c`**: Extended analysis of nested `if` conditions.
- **`switch.c`**: Details the use of the `switch` statement with different cases and fall-through behavior.
